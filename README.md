# replacement-bodybuilding-coach
A short, basic Python function I created to assist me with my bodybuilding goals.

This function takes your weight, calorie, carb cycle and comments data to give you suggestions of whether or not you are on track to hit your goals. 

Current version - Added Sentiment analysis to analyse comments

Future version - Retrain roBERTa for more niche bodybuilding terms. Convert this into a probability of whether or not you are on track rather than giving a definitive answer.
