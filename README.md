# replacement-bodybuilding-coach
A Python function i created to assist me with my bodybuilding goals.

This function takes your weight, calorie, carb cycle and comments data to give you suggestions of whether or not you are on track to hit your goals. This is the first version. In future iterations i want to implement sentiment analysis to create a view on how much the diet is affecting your mood. This will be updated over the coming weeks.
